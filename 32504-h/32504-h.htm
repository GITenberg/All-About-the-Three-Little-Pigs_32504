<p>
Once upon a time there was an old pig with three little pigs, and,
as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their
fortunes.
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-08b.png"><img src="images/ill-08b-s.png" width="100" height="150" alt="Pig with handkerchief on a stick" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>
The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to
him, "Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house;" which the
man did, and the little pig built a house with it.
</p>

<div class="figure-l">
<a href="images/ill-09.png"><img src="images/ill-09-s.png" width="150" height="50" alt="Bundle of straw" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-10.jpg"><img src="images/ill-10-s.jpg" width="350" height="465" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p><!--[Blank Page]-->&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>
Presently a wolf came along and knocked at the door, and said, "Little
pig, little pig, let me come in!"
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-11.png"><img src="images/ill-11-s.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Wolf knocking at door" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="figure-l">
<a href="images/ill-12.png"><img src="images/ill-12-s.png" width="150" height="141" alt="Crying pig" /></a>
</div>

<p style="clear: both;">
To which the pig answered, "No, no, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"
</p>
<p>
This made the wolf angry, and he said, "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff,
and I'll blow your house in!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the
little pig.
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-13.png"><img src="images/ill-13-s.png" width="150" height="145" alt="Wolf eating up the little pig" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>
The second little pig met a man who was chopping wood, and said,
"Please, man, give me some of that wood to build me a house;" which
the man did, and the pig built his house with it.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-14.png"><img src="images/ill-14-s.png" width="400" height="200" alt="Pig meets a man chopping wood" /></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>
Then along came the wolf, and said:
</p>
<p>
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"
</p>
<p>
"No, no, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>
"Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!"
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-18.png"><img src="images/ill-18-s.png" width="400" height="135" alt="Frightened pig being huffed and puffed at" /></a>
</div>

<p>
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last
he blew the house down and then ate up the little pig.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>
The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said, "Please,
man, give me those bricks to build a house with;" so the man gave him
the bricks, and he built his house with them.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-19.png"><img src="images/ill-19-s.png" width="400" height="245" alt="Pig meets man with bricks" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>
Then the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said,
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"
</p>
<p>
"No, no, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"
</p>

</div>

<p>
"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."
</p>
<p>
Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and puffed, and he puffed
and huffed; but he could not get the house down.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span></p>

</div>

<p style="clear:both;">
When he found that he could not with all his huffing and puffing, blow
the house down, he said, "Little pig, I know where there is a nice field
of turnips."
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-24b.png"><img src="images/ill-24b-s.png" width="150" height="135" alt="Wolf" /></a>

<p>
"Where?" said the little pig.

<a href="images/ill-25.png"><img src="images/ill-25-s.png" width="400" height="145" alt="Little pig's house" /></a>
</div>

<p>
"Oh, in Mr. Smith's homefield, and if you will be ready to-morrow
morning, I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some
for dinner."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<div class="figure-l">

</div>

<p style="clear:both;">
"Very well," said the little pig, "I will be ready. What time do you
mean to go?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, at six o'clock."
</p>

<div class="figure-r">

</div>

<p style="clear:both;">
Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf
came&mdash;which he did about six&mdash;and said, "Little pig, are you ready?"
</p>
<p>
The little pig said, "Ready! I have been, and come back again, and got
a nice potful for dinner!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-30.png"><img src="images/ill-30-s.png" width="400" height="280" alt="Wolf at pear tree" /></a>
</div>

<p>
The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought he would be up to the
little pig somehow or other, so he said, "Little pig, I know where there
is a nice pear tree."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>
"Where?" said the pig.
</p>
<p>
"Down at Merry-Garden," replied the wolf, "and if you will not deceive
me, I will come for you at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go
together and get some pears."
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-31.png"><img src="images/ill-31-s.png" width="150" height="160" alt="Clock showing 5 o'clock" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>
Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and
went off for the pears, hoping to get back before the wolf came.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-33.jpg"><img src="images/ill-33-s.jpg" width="350" height="465" alt="" /></a>

<a href="images/ill-35a.png"><img src="images/ill-35a-s.png" width="200" height="155" alt="Pig" /></a>
</div>

<p>
But he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that, just as
he was getting down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may
suppose, frightened him very much.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-35b.png"><img src="images/ill-35b-s.png" width="300" height="100" alt="Wolf, running" /></a>

</div>

<p style="clear: both;">
When the wolf came up he said, "What! are you here before me? Are they
nice pears?"
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-36b.png"><img src="images/ill-36b-s.png" width="250" height="150" alt="Wolf, looking up at pig in tree" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>
"Yes, very," said the little pig. "I will throw you down one;" and he
threw it so far that, while the wolf was going to pick it up, the little
pig jumped down and ran home.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-37.png"><img src="images/ill-37-s.png" width="250" height="155" alt="Pear, bouncing down from tree" /></a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-38.png"><img src="images/ill-38-s.png" width="300" height="160" alt="Pig buying ticket at fair" /></a>
</div>

<p>
The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig, "Little
pig, there is a Fair at Shanklin this afternoon; will you go?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes," said the pig, "I will be glad to go; what time will you be
ready?"
</p>
<p>
"At three," said the wolf.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p><!--[Blank Page]-->&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>[39]</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>
So the little pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the
Fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was taking home when he saw
the wolf coming.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-41.png"><img src="images/ill-41-s.png" width="250" height="100" alt="Wolf, coming to fair" /></a>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-42a.png"><img src="images/ill-42a-s.png" width="300" height="210" alt="Pig, rolling downhill in barrel" /></a>
</div>

<p>
Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and
by doing so turned it over,

<!--Actual end of page 41 -->

                            and it rolled down the hill with the pig in
it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to
the fair.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="images/ill-42b.png"><img src="images/ill-42b-s.png" width="350" height="160" alt="Frightened wolf running away" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>
He went to the little pig's house, and told him how he had been
frightened by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.
Then the little pig said, "Ha! I frightened you then. I had been to
the Fair and bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you I got into it
and rolled down the hill."
</p>

<div class="figure-r">
<a href="images/ill-43.png"><img src="images/ill-43-s.png" width="100" height="120" alt="Butter churn" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>
Then the wolf was very angry, indeed, and declared he would eat up
the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.

When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on a pot
<!--above line of text moved down from page 44-->
 full of
water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming
down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf! So the little pig put
on the cover again in an instant, boiled up the wolf, and ate him for
supper, and lived happy forever afterwards.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
